# Generate transcript app

This is a simple web app in Django to get the transcription of a media file and allow the user to work on it.

## Motivation

A person close to me (an English teacher) needed to create review English speakings and an easy way to
quickly generate educational material out of media content.

## Available functionalities

- Upload media file (video / audio)
- Follow captions while media plays
- Save progress to local as JSON
- Load dump from local as JSON
- Add + assign speakers to conversation
- Generate PDF report with editions
- Go to caption timestamp in media (WIP)
- Add comments to captions to be shown in report (WIP)
