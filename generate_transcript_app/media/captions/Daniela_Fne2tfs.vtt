00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Good afternoon, my name is Seriana, I'm going to read your exam.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.800
What's your name?

00:04.800 --> 00:06.800
My name is Seriana.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.800
Manila, where do you live?

00:08.800 --> 00:12.300
I live in the lower floor.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.300
Do you work or do you study?

00:14.300 --> 00:19.800
I study for Oso.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.300
Great.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.300
Manila, what is your favorite type of music?

00:24.300 --> 00:37.900
I don't have a favorite type of music because I heard oil.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.900
Do you prefer the mornings or the evenings?

00:41.900 --> 00:49.900
The mornings because I am more promoted.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.100
Will you use English in the future?

00:53.100 --> 00:58.300
Can you use English in the future?

00:58.300 --> 01:14.500
Yes, for example, traveling because English is the global language, I think, for communicate with other people.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.500
Great.

01:15.500 --> 01:22.500
I'm going to do a photograph.

01:22.500 --> 01:33.500
Okay, do you hear your photograph?

01:33.500 --> 01:39.500
It shows some people learning language.

01:39.500 --> 01:45.500
I want to describe the photograph for about a minute.

01:45.500 --> 02:00.500
In this first picture, I can see a group of I think that they are friends that are studied in a library.

02:00.500 --> 02:06.500
They are studying how to live with.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.500
For example, an exam.

02:10.500 --> 02:19.500
I can save a boy to girls.

02:19.500 --> 02:26.500
They are older than me.

02:26.500 --> 02:34.500
I think they are in the university, for example, a physical.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.500
Great.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.500
Let's move to part three.

02:38.500 --> 02:44.500
In this part of the test, you are going to talk about something with me for about two minutes.

02:44.500 --> 02:48.500
I'm going to describe the situation to you.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.500
The exam works very hard and has only one three day a week.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.500
He wants to find an activity to help him relax.

02:56.500 --> 03:01.500
Here are some of the activities he could do to relax.

03:01.500 --> 03:07.500
Let's talk together about the activities he could do and say which would be the most relaxing.

03:08.500 --> 03:22.500
I think the most relaxing is stay at home every hour because he is alone.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.500
There isn't this too.

03:26.500 --> 03:39.500
For example, this picture that he is in a party and he cannot relax.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
I agree with you.

03:40.500 --> 03:45.500
I think going to a party is going to be more stressful than relaxing.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.500
He only has one day to relax.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
Maybe next day he has to go back to work.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.500
Maybe reading a book at home would be a great idea.

03:54.500 --> 04:02.500
Or I also think that having a walk at the park with his dog could be relaxing because he is seeing a lot of nature.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.500
What do you think?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
I agree with you.

04:05.500 --> 04:15.500
I think that another way to relax is going to be a bed.

04:15.500 --> 04:28.500
Because you can hear the sound of the water.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
You are alone.

04:30.500 --> 04:35.500
I think this is the most relaxing.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.500
I agree with you.

04:37.500 --> 04:44.500
Maybe the beach can also be stressful because of the sand.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
It also depends on the weather.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.500
Maybe if it is raining or hailing you can go to the beach.

04:49.500 --> 05:02.500
Maybe staying at home, preparing a recipe, could also be relaxing because you can take your time to prepare a bowl of pasta or cake.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.500
I agree with you.

05:05.500 --> 05:28.500
I think that it is stressful too because if the recipe didn't go to the point that he likes to eat, for example,

05:28.500 --> 05:49.500
he didn't follow the path and I think going to swim is a relaxing way.

05:49.500 --> 05:59.500
I think that either going to swim or staying at home, bringing a book would be the best and most relaxing activity for him.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
Are you agree?

06:01.500 --> 06:02.500
I agree.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.500
Now I am going to ask you a few questions.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.500
Vanilla, who do you spend your free time with?

06:10.500 --> 06:16.500
I spend my free time with my friends and my family.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.500
What do you usually do?

06:18.500 --> 06:25.500
I, or with my family, stay at home and with my friends.

06:25.500 --> 06:33.500
For example, we go to Puerto Enetia because we can't do a lot of things there.

06:33.500 --> 06:38.500
Vanilla, is it important to do exercise in your free time?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
Yes.

06:41.500 --> 06:56.500
To be a healthier, I think that doing exercise in our free time is good.

06:57.500 --> 07:03.500
And do you ever listen to music while you are relaxing?

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
No.

07:04.500 --> 07:09.500
Because I relax and sleep.

07:09.500 --> 07:16.500
And with music, I cannot relax and I can sleep.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
Thank you.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
Felicity of the test.
